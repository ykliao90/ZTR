# Zero Time Reconstruction
This project aims at automating the zero time reconstruction for the two pulse ESEEM following the method developed by W. B. Mims. [1] The method will be separated into several sections, including:
* Automatically picking peaks of the modulations and exporting the zero-time echo intensity.
* Allow manually picking frequency to apply window function in the frequency domain
* -> Next stage to automatically pick the frequencies according to a certain noise level
* Inverse Fourier transform the processed frequency domain spectrum and export result.
